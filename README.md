# Data-analysis-and-prediction-of-COVID-19
The virus named 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that is recognized as the primary source of an outburst of respiratory sickness originally detected in Wuhan, China. As the outbreak of this respiratory illness (COVID-19) advances, epidemiological information is required to escort the process of intervention strategies and situational awareness.  This paper presents the analysis and future prediction of corona cases based on the present positive cases using Machine Learning algorithms such as SVM, Polynomial Regression and Bayesian Ridge approach. The accuracy is measured using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) and it is observed that the error with respect to Bayesian Ridge is comparatively less meaning the accuracy is high as compared to other algorithms.
